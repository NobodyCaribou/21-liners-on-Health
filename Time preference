Time preference [4.11.22]

Health is a long game

One's health is the output of low time preference decisions that reflect a long term mindset

What's difficult in the short term often leads to positive long term outcomes and what's easy in the short term often leads to negative long term outcomes

In a fiat world underlined by high time preference incentives, Health is the exception and disease is the norm

Treating symptoms without addressing the underlying root cause of the problem is a high time preference action

Taking responsibility for our well being by working daily to understand how to care for ourselves is a low time preference endeavour

Learning about health and consistently making changes in our lives in order to align our behaviours with natural inputs requires focus and energy

Low time preference: waiting until problems arise and doing the bare minimum to manage the symptoms of the problem

High time preference: working everyday on our Health in order to prevent problems from developing and build resilience

Medicine is built on a fiat foundation and therefore adopts high time preference incentives
