The six pillars [4.18.22]

health is a broad term so it can be helpful to break it down into more concrete elements we call pillars. They are the primary factors in health

Separating the pillars is conceptual only and each of the 6 pillars are bidirectionally interdependent on the others

Food - the raw materials for tissue repair/healing and a major source of energy

Movement - use it or lose it

Mind - the keystone pillar. health begins with the right mindset

Community - the glue. The secret sauce for success

Sleep - recovery

Financial literacy (/Money): The gateway pillar. Money is the tool we use to store our time

Using money that doesn't steal our time (Bitcoin) is a crucial element in having time available to spend on our health

Define gateway, keystone
