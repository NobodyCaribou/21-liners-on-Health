Health vs. health [4.12.22]

Health (uppercase): Individual, environment and community health

Health is the output of low time preference decisions made by individuals, businesses & governments with a focus on Health

Low time preference money (Bitcoin) creates incentives that form the foundation for a Healthy world

High time preference money (fiat) creates incentives that nudge society towards disease and environmental degradation 

health (lowercase): Physical, mental, spiritual health of the individual

health is an output which is dependent on the quality of inputs we provide our bodies and minds

Inputs: movement habits, food, sleep, relationships, media, sense of purpose, relationships with people / work / money

health is a lifelong process that requires time and energy

Fiat money steals our time and therefore prevents us from having enough time to care for ourselves

Health is the cumulative result of health - it starts at the individual level with people taking responsibility for their well being
