health success [4.15.22]

Formula guaranteed to result in health success:

1. Every morning, write down things you want to do to improve your health

2. Do them

It sounds simple because it is

You see, health is actually very simple and success has a clear path. We’re the only ones that mystify and complexify it

Simple doesn’t mean easy. It’s easy to make excuses. It’s hard to do the work and to take full responsibility for our well being

It’s only when you take action that change begins to happen. The key is to focus on each day

Each day we either move forward or backwards and success requires us to make a conscious choice to move forward

What divides those who succeed and those who don’t is a willingness to put in the work. A commitment to doing the things that improve our health

Those who succeed wake up everyday and do the things that must be done. Those who continue making excuses continue sliding backwards
